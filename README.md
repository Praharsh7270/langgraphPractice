# LangGraph Practice Projects

This repository contains various projects demonstrating the use of LangGraph for machine learning and graph-based workflows.

## Projects

### 1. Basic LangGraph Example
A simple project to illustrate the fundamentals of LangGraph, including node creation, edge definition, and graph traversal.

### 2. ML Workflow Automation
Automates machine learning workflows using LangGraph, covering data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

### 3. Custom Graph Algorithms
Implements custom graph algorithms (e.g., shortest path, clustering) using LangGraph's API.

### 4. Integration with ML Libraries
Shows how to integrate LangGraph with popular ML libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/langgraphPractice.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   Or, for faster and isolated installation, use [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):
    ```bash
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   To install `uv`:
    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```
3. Explore individual project folders for usage instructions.
